This list is far from being complete: there are literally hundreds of brands, and C-Media chips are very popular in the low cost sector. If you can't find your card in this list, but you are certain that it has a C-Media 8738 or 8768 chip, the driver will work. There's effectively just one reference hardware design in use by all the manufacturers - there are some minor deviations, but these have no effect on the core functionality of the driver.
If you plan to buy such a card, make sure that there's a C-Media 8738 or 8768 chip on the board and that there are dedicated digital connectors. The standard version of these cards (without Dolby Live!) are widely available for roughly 15-20 USD/EUR (e.g. on eBay).

If you are successfully using the driver with a soundcard which isn't listed here, please mail me the device name (e.g. Trust SC-5250), the operating system (e.g. Windows Vista Home Premium) and the device/vendor ID.
